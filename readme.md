1. npm install expo-cli --global (global flag is to make expo available on your machine, not just on this project)

2. clone the repository (to have access to the code locally)

3. run npm install or yarn (to install all required dependencies)

4. npx expo start (to run the project locally)

5. if everything is great, a prompt should be up asking you to select what platform you want to run the app on.
